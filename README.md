# Hypercript
Hypercript is a new kind of encryption algorithm. It is not a finished alogrithm, so please do NOT use this in finished products!
I will keep you guys updated with details on its' up keep.

Edit - DEC/ 28th/ 2020 : 

A new update was added, such that the main code was moved to a separate method. The over hall process is going to being within the day. I would like to make this algorithm usable even if the open code is visible. I believe this can be done by cleverly allowing the user to manipulate the algorithm as they see fit. It's a work in progress. STILL NOT PRODUCTION READY! So please don't use this in production code!
